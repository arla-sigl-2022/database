# Databases Workshop

This workshop is aimed for students of EPITA SIGL 2022.

In this workshop, you will learn:
- how to create a database
- how to manage it
- how to serve your data from your Web API

Since there is several different types of databases, we've prepared different examples with different databases:
- [A relational database using PostgreSQL](postgresql/)
- [A NoSQL document oriented database using MongoDB](mongodb/)
